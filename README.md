### How to run the app

1. Make sure the system has the correct PHP version (8.2.3) in our case and composer installed
2. Clone the project from https://github.com/ElijahBus/albums-songs-manager.git 
3. `cd` in the project root folder and run `composer install` to have all dependencies installed in the application
4. Create a `.env` file in the root folder and copy in it everything from `.env.example` then run `php artisan key:generate`
5. Run as well `npm install` and `npm run dev` to install and build npm packages
6. Configure properly the following keys in the `.env` file:
   ````
   DB_CONNECTION=mysql
   DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
   DB_PORT=3306
   DB_DATABASE=albums_songs_manager
   DB_USERNAME=user # Not root 
   DB_PASSWORD=password
   ````
7. In case you have docker on your system, run `docker-compose up -d` from the root folder of the application,
it will run a MySQL container on port `3306` that you can use. otherwise just install MySQL and configure it following the instruction on your operating system.
8. Once MySQL is installed and the connection is well established, create the database with the name given for `DB_DATABASE` in your `.env` file, then run `php artisan migrate` to have all tables created.
9. Once successful, run `php artisan db:seed --class=GenreSeeder` to have the song genres seeded.
10. Boom you're good, run `php artisan serve` , visit your app on the running port, register an account, and have fun ðŸŽ‰

### Bonus

If you decide to play around with the codes, don't worry, the `tests` have got you covered, you can run `php artisan test` at any time to make sure nothing broke.
